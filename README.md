Project - Munder Difflin Paper Co. Website

Project Guidelines - To create a one page website for a fictional paper company that is exciting for the end user.

For this project I wanted to use my knowledge of the show "The Office" to suppliment my knowledge of the client and of the target user. Using the data I have from the show, I decided to make a page focused on facilitating connections between Munder Difflin's dedicated sales team, and small business owners.  The page uses the familiarity of flipping through paper to guide the user to the 'Contact' section of the site.
